2. Get the following credentials from your Twilio dashboard:
   - **Account SID**
   - **Auth Token**
   - **Twilio Phone Number**

3. Open **Notepad** and create a new file named **.env** inside the program folder.
4. Copy and paste the following content, replacing placeholders with your Twilio details:  
   ```  
   TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_account_sid  
   TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_auth_token  
   TWILIO_FROM_NUMBER=your_twilio_phone_number  
   TO_NUMBER=your_phone_number  
   ```
5. **Save the file** inside the program directory.
